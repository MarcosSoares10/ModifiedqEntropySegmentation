# Hybrid Modifiedentropy-based with Modified MRF for structural magnetic resonance image segmentation

C++ version of 3d Slicer Module algorithm proposed by colleague Mehran Azimbagirad from CSIM Laboratory on [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0730725X19303558), [Abstract](https://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/CSIM-lab_Mqe-MMRF.pdf)

This algorithm is able to segment between 3 brain tissues, White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) using a modified Markov Random Field (MRF).
